This is my first project involving algorithmic patterns and actions.  My initial idea was based off of the design of a kaleidoscope.  The user would click the screen and a triangle would appear, and according to the location of their next click, subsequent triangles would start rotating, creating a kaleidoscope effect.  However, as I started learning how to incorporate classes the rotate function, I decided to do something a bit more abstract.  I built a class of triangles that travel in circles with a radius proportional to the distance between the location of the mouse clicked and a point indicated in the code.  I also integrated a rollover command to change the stroke of the stars when the mouse hovers over them.  My idea is that the user will click on different stars and watch the background morph into a fascinating design.  This code is a metaphor for my personal experience with coding.  At first, my code does not always look beautiful and can seem messy or purposeless.  However, in the end, it comes together nicely, similarly to how my project performs beautifully toward the end of its life cycle.
